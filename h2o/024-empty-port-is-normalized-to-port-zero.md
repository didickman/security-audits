# Empty port accepted as port zero

## Classification
- Type: validation gap
- Severity: medium
- Confidence: certain

## Affected Locations
- `lib/common/url.c:226` (port loop in `h2o_url_parse_hostport`)

## Summary
- `h2o_url_parse_hostport` accepts an authority ending in a lone `:` and normalizes the missing port to `0`.
- This causes malformed inputs such as `host:` and `http://example.com:/` to be parsed as valid authorities with explicit port zero instead of being rejected.

## Provenance
- Verified finding reproduced from scanner report and code-path analysis.
- Source: Swival Security Scanner, `https://swival.dev`

## Preconditions
- URL authority contains a host followed by a lone colon.
- Parsing reaches `h2o_url_parse_hostport` through URL or authority handling.

## Proof
- In `lib/common/url.c:226`, encountering `:` enters port parsing with an accumulator initialized to `0`.
- If the next byte is end-of-string, `/`, or `?`, the digit loop executes zero times.
- Because no check requires at least one digit after `:`, the function assigns `*port = 0` and returns success.
- This is externally reachable through `h2o_url_parse` and `parse_authority_and_path`, so malformed inputs like `http://127.0.0.1:/` and `http://example.com:/` survive validation.
- Reproduction confirms downstream impact: socket-pool connection setup uses the parsed port directly for `sin_port` and for named-host stringification, and `Host` header authority parsing reuses the same helper so `Host: example.com:` is treated as explicit port `0` rather than rejected.

## Why This Is A Real Bug
- A lone `:` in authority syntax denotes a port delimiter, so accepting zero digits is malformed parsing behavior.
- The resulting port `0` is observably consumed by networking and routing code, changing behavior rather than failing closed.
- The codebase already treats port `0` as invalid in related paths, which is consistent with rejection being the intended behavior.

## Fix Requirement
- Require at least one decimal digit after `:` before accepting a port.
- If no digit follows the colon, return failure instead of assigning `0`.

## Patch Rationale
- The patch adds an explicit post-`:` digit-presence check in `h2o_url_parse_hostport`.
- This is the narrowest fix because it preserves existing valid port parsing while rejecting only the malformed empty-port case at the normalization source.

## Residual Risk
- None
